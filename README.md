# Waste-Management-System
# Waste Classification AI Web Application

## Introduction

This repository houses the development of an AI-based web application for waste classification. The project is driven by the pressing need for effective waste management to combat issues like landfill overflows, pollution, and toxicity. The primary objectives include reducing landfill waste, minimizing environmental pollution, and automating the classification of waste into Organic (O) and Recyclable (R) categories.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

**Data Preprocessing**:
   - Explains data exploration, cleaning, and data augmentation.
   - Visualizes data distribution.

**Model Development**:
   - Describes the selection of AI techniques and their implementation.
   - Ensures code is well-structured and reusable.
   - Covers model training using the training dataset.

**Model Evaluation**:
   - Details model evaluation metrics and performance analysis.

**Web Application Prototype**:
   - Code for the Web App
